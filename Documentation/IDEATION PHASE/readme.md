ðŸ“š Book Nest â€“ Ideation Phase

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
**Book Nest** is an initiative to create a user-friendly online platform where users can share, borrow, lend, or donate books within a community. This project promotes book circulation, reading culture, and sustainability.

## ðŸ§© Problem statement
Many good books lie unused in homes while others lack access to affordable reading material. There is a need for a system that connects people who have books with those who need them.
