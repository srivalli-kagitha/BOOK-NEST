ðŸ“˜ Book Nest â€“ Design Phase

Book Nest aims to connect readers through a platform for sharing, lending, and donating books.  
We identified a strong problem-solution fit by addressing book accessibility and reducing waste.  
The proposed solution includes a web app with search, listing, user profiles, and geo-tagging.  
Our solution architecture uses React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB.  
Next, we'll finalize UI wireframes and begin MVP development based on this architecture.
